# Mobile App Setup

This directory will contain the React Native mobile app project.

To create a new React Native app with Android support (including Gradle build files), follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js, npm/yarn, and React Native CLI installed.
2. Run the following command to create a new React Native app:

```bash
npx react-native init MobileApp
```

3. This will create a new directory `MobileApp` with Android and iOS native projects, including Gradle files for Android.
4. Navigate to the `MobileApp` directory and run the app on Android emulator or device:

```bash
cd MobileApp
npx react-native run-android
```

5. You can then modify the `App.js` file inside the `MobileApp` directory to integrate live data and predictions from your backend.

If you want me to create a basic React Native app structure here or help with specific code for live data display in the mobile app, please let me know.
